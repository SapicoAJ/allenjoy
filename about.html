      <p class="w3-large w3-justify">St. Louis College Valenzuela, founded in 1976 as the Philippine College of Technological Resources (PCTR), focuses on the education and development of productive and responsible citizens in Christian-centered values. The school began operations in 1978 and expanded to include secondary school and college facilities. In the 1980s, the college introduced technical-vocational courses to improve the employment options of financially-strapped Filipino youth. In 1983, Agnes O. Luciano assumed the presidency, and the college expanded its facilities, including pre-school, primary school, and tertiary education. By the mid-1990s, PCTR was admitted as an affiliate school of St. Louis University (SLU) and its affiliated schools, under the SLU Superintendent of Schools.

		In 2002, Raymond O. Luciano assumed the presidency, and the school has undergone continuous expansion and modernization, including the addition of a new site for a pre-school and elementary school, new fire alarm systems, security cameras, emergency lighting, and Wi-Fi systems. The school's diverse faculty and students contribute to the Filipino dream as productive and responsible citizens, making it a proud educational institution in Valenzuela.</p>

		<h1 class="w3-center">Our Philosophy</h1><br>
		<p class="w3-large w3-justify">We believe that every human being has the capacity to develop his intellect and free will. Academic excellence at St. Louis College Valenzuela is not solely focused on the acquisition of knowledge and the upgrading of skills, rather, the institution shall also provide the proper venue for the pursuit of wisdom which becomes the basic source from which the students discern, judge, and act on the different facets of reality.
<br>
<br>
			We believe that in all areas of academic life, the process of discerning truth is guided by a clear and critical study of the objective conditions of reality. Truth is consistent with the purpose of law and justice and enhanced by a free exchange of ideas.
			<br>
			<br>
			We believe that the achievement of the fullness of its Christian orientation is primarily founded on the inculcation of the virtue of charity among its students. St. Louis College Valenzuela trains students to be men for others, aware of economic, political, and socio-cultural realities. They empower them to participate in nation building and change, recognizing Christian benevolence through genuine concern, commitment, and decisive action for society.</p>

			<br>
			March 9,1568 - June 21,1591
			<br>
			The Patron Saint of Students
			<br>
			 <br>
			
			 St. Aloysius Gonzaga, the eldest son of Marquis Ferdinand Gonzaga, was raised in luxury and destined for a military career. His mother favored the church, while his father pursued a military career. Aloysius learned various expressions from soldiers and resisted them, eventually becoming a monk at the age of seven. At the court of Florence, he made a vow of perpetual chastity and lived like a monk. At 13, he was appointed page at the Spanish court but showed modesty and recollection.
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 At 17, he became a Jesuit novice in Rome. His modesty, friendliness, and recollection made him an ideal religious figure. He excelled in kitchen tasks and performed the most mundane tasks during the plague epidemic. At the time of his death, he was overjoyed and cried out "We are going, gladly." Pope Benedict XII proclaimed him the patron of young students, and Pius XI named him the patron of youth in 1926.
			<br>
			 <br>
			 
			
			His feast is celebrated June 21.
